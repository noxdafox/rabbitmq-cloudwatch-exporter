# RabbitMQ AWS CloudWatch exporter

A plugin for exporting RabbitMQ metrics collected by the Management Plugin to [AWS CloudWatch](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

## Installing

Download the `.ez` files from the latest [release](https://github.com/noxdafox/rabbitmq-cloudwatch-exporter/releases) and copy them into the [RabbitMQ plugins directory](http://www.rabbitmq.com/relocate.html).

Enable the plugin:

```bash
[sudo] rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_cloudwatch_exporter
```

## Building from Source

Please see RabbitMQ Plugin Development guide.

To build the plugin:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/noxdafox/rabbitmq-cloudwatch-exporter.git
cd rabbitmq-cloudwatch-exporter
make dist
```

Then copy all the *.ez files inside the plugins folder to the [RabbitMQ plugins directory](http://www.rabbitmq.com/relocate.html) and enable the plugin:

```bash
[sudo] rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_cloudwatch_exporter
```

### AWS Credentials

To resolve AWS credentials, the standard environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are looked up first. Otherwise, the EC2 instance role or ECS task role are employed.

## Exporting RabbitMQ metrics to CloudWatch

### AWS Credentials

To resolve AWS credentials, the standard environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` are looked up first. Otherwise, the EC2 instance role or ECS task role are employed.

Alternatively, the User can specify them in the `rabbitmq.conf` file as follows.

```shell
cloudwatch_exporter.aws.access_key_id = "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"
cloudwatch_exporter.aws.secret_access_key = "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
```

Or in the `rabbitmq.config` format.

```erlang
[{rabbitmq_cloudwatch_exporter,
  [{aws, [{access_key_id, "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE"},
          {secret_access_key, "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"}]}]}].
```

### AWS Region

By default the metrics are published within the `us-east-1` AWS region. The region can be changed in the `rabbitmq.conf` file as follows.

```shell
cloudwatch_exporter.aws.region = "us-west-1"
```

Or in the `rabbitmq.config` format.

```erlang
[{rabbitmq_cloudwatch_exporter,
  [{aws, [{region, "us-west-1"}]}]}].
```

### Metrics collection

Metrics are grouped in different categories described below. Each category must be enabled in the configuration in order for its metrics to be exported.

`rabbitmq.conf` example.

```shell
cloudwatch_exporter.metrics.overview.enable = true
cloudwatch_exporter.metrics.vhost.enable = true
# Omitting or setting a group to false is equivalent
cloudwatch_exporter.metrics.node.enable = false
```

`rabbitmq.config` example.

```erlang
[{rabbitmq_cloudwatch_exporter,
  [{metrics, [{overview, [{enable, true}]},
              {vhost, [{enable, true}]},
              {node, [{enable, false}]}]}]}].
```

If a metrics group is enabled, all its metrics will be exported. The `export_metrics` configuration parameter allows to further limit which metrics of a specific group to export.

`rabbitmq.conf` example.

```shell
cloudwatch_exporter.metrics.exchange.enable = true
cloudwatch_exporter.metrics.exchange.export_metrics.1 = "PublishIn"
cloudwatch_exporter.metrics.exchange.export_metrics.2 = "PublishOut"
```

`rabbitmq.config` example.

```erlang
[{rabbitmq_cloudwatch_exporter,
  [{metrics, [{exchange, [{enable, true},
                          {export_metrics, ["PublishIn", "PublishOut"]}]}]}]}].
```

For `exchange`, `queue`, `connection` and `channel` metrics groups, it is possible to control the names of the entities to be published via regular expressions.

`rabbitmq.conf` example.

```shell
cloudwatch_exporter.metrics.exchange.enable = true
# Only export exchanges which names begin with foo or end with bar
cloudwatch_exporter.metrics.exchange.export_regex = "foo.*|.*bar"

cloudwatch_exporter.metrics.queue.enable = true
# Exclude server-named queues
cloudwatch_exporter.metrics.queue.export_regex = "^(?!amq.gen-.*).*$"
```

`rabbitmq.config` example.

```erlang
[{rabbitmq_cloudwatch_exporter,
  [{metrics, [{exchange, [{enable, true},
                          {export_regex, "foo.*|.*bar"}]},
              {queue, [{enable, true},
                       {export_regex, "^(?!amq.gen-.*).*$"}]}]}]}].
```

Metrics are exported every minute. The export period can be expressed in seconds via the `cloudwatch_exporter.export_period` configuration parameter (`rabbitmq_cloudwatch_exporter.export_period` in `rabbitmq.config` format). CloudWatch metrics have a [standard resolution](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/publishingMetrics.html#high-resolution-metrics) of one minute. Therefore, publishing more than once per minute will results in the metrics being aggregated on the receiving end. The `cloudwatch_exporter.storage_resolution` configuration parameter (`rabbitmq_cloudwatch_exporter.storage_resolution` in `rabbitmq.config` format) allows to decrease the aggregation period to 1, 5, 10 or 30 seconds.

Lastly, the [AWS CloudWatch namespace](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Namespace) can be controlled via the `cloudwatch_exporter.namespace` configuration parameter (`rabbitmq_cloudwatch_exporter.namespace` in `rabbitmq.config` format). The default value is `RabbitMQ`.

### Metrics

Metrics are grouped in different categories. All the metrics grouped within a category are characterised by a set of [dimensions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/cloudwatch_concepts.html#Dimension) which help to identify their belonging.

As AWS CloudWatch charges a [monthly cost](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/pricing/) per each metric, the CloudWatch Exporter Plugin exports a limited subset of metrics which are deemed relevant. If a particular metric is missing, please open an [Issue Ticket](https://github.com/noxdafox/rabbitmq-cloudwatch-exporter/issues) or submit a [Pull Request](https://github.com/noxdafox/rabbitmq-cloudwatch-exporter/pulls) to add it to the exported ones. For the same rationale, the CloudWatch Exporter Plugin only exports metrics from the categories which have been enabled in the configuration file.
